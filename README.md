# Running the model
1) Download this code from GitHub
2) Open BASELINE_global_variables.py and edit the file paths to match the paths of your computer. In future versions, I will make this into relative pathing. 
3) Run either BASELINE_SEP_30_23_monthly.py or BASELINE_SEP_12_23_deterministic.py
	- The first model is probabilistic. See instructions below.
	- The second model is deterministic.

I will write more instructions later on how to adjust the number of simulations and select the metrics for the simulations (NPV, CAC, TC, etc)
